Capstone Project - YouTube Data Harvesting

The purpose of this project is to create a Streamlit basic app which allows users to access and analyze YouTube channel details using channel IDs.

This app has the option for users to enter channel IDs - using which this app fetches all the requisite information via YouTube api, and store them in MongoDB.
This app also allows the user the option of migrating the data to MySQL.
